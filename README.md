## Emotion Detection using CNN-HMM Model

CS5010 Project

This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network - Hidden Markov Model (CNN-HMM) model for emotion detection. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize six basic emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, and disgusted.The model is deployed to a Flask web application, where users can upload an image containing a human face, and the application will detect the emotion expressed in the image.
